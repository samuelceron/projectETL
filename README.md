# projectETL
## Project ETL from Data Analytics Bootcamp

For our project we choose Kaggle.com as our source, as we could find a lot of databases for our project.

We choose Steam as our database as it had 6 csv files which we could work for our Relational Database Model.

We choose a Relational Database Model because we have structured data in csv files.

Steam is a video game digital distribution service by Valve. So it’s a Shop were you can download or buy videogames for computers.

The original structure includes 6 tables with information regarding 27,033 video games, gathered around May 2019 from the Steam Store.

Which we then Extracted and Transformed the data with the Jupyter-Notebook.

So we could finally upload it to PGadmin.
